# Installing  git

1. Install git

2. Sign up for a GitHub account

# Make sure that you can see invisible files in the Finder

3. In your computer's **file browser** ensure that you can see:
  - **Invisible files and folders** (On the Mac these start with a period e.g. `.git`)

  - **File extensions** (This is the part of the filename at the *end* after a period. For example in the filename `test.doc`  the extension is `.doc`)

  - Many of the files that git needs to function are files that begin with a period which are **invisible files** on the Mac OS (operating system).


4. Cloning a repository from GitHub

  - A repository on GitHub exists as a **remote repository**.

  - To work on the files on your own computer, you can **clone** the repository which creates a local copy on your computer.  

  - You can then synchronize the files between the your computer and the remote repository on GitHub.

  - To clone a repository, first find the **URL** for the repository on GitHub

  ![Find the URL for the repository on GitHub](Images/git-url.png)

  - In the terminal, navigate to the **directory** on your computer to which you want to  copy the repository e.g `cd ~/my_git_repos`

  - Once in that directory,  type `git clone https: [your_repository]`.  For example `git clone https://github.com/joannamorris/lab_tutorials.git`

  - This creates a copy of the entire repository in your directory. Now you can edit the files without worrying about making a mistake messing up the files that are safely stored in the GitHub repo remotely in the cloud.

  - When you are ready to add your changes, you must upload your changed files to the remote GitHub repository.

5. Forking vs Cloning

  - Like a clone, a **fork** is a copy of a repository that you manage, and that let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository.

   - When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository but the repository remains on your GitHub account.

   - The changes made in the cloned repository (on your local computer) are **pushed** (or uploaded) to the forked repository.

   - Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a **pull request** which is a request to the original the repository owner to merge your changes with (or **pull** your changes into) the original repository.


   - Summary of the steps to add anything to the requisite github project:

    - ***Step 1***: The user **forks** a repository to their own GitHub account.

    - ***Step 2***: The user **clones** the repository to his or her local machine.

    - ***Step 3***: The user edits the files and then **commits** these edits to the local repository. A contributor can apply a single commit or multiple commits to the repository. But everything happens on his or her local system.

    - ***Step 4***: The user **pushes** the modifications to the upstream repository on his or her account (the fork).

    - ***Step 5***: The user sends a a request to the owner of the original repository to merge (pull) the changes into the main central repository.  This is a **pull request**.

  B. Fetch and Rebase

   - When you **fork** a repository,  it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository.

   - Using the terminal, The `remote` command shows which remote repositories are currently connected to your local repository. It also allows you to add new connections or remove existing ones.

   - Each connection to your local repository has a *name* and a *URL*.


  C. Linking local and remote repositories

   - Linking your local repository (the one on your computer) to remote repositories on GitHub

    - If you **clone** a repository, the command automatically adds that **remote repository** under the name `origin`.


   2. The git commands `fetch`, `pull`, `merge`, `push` and `sync`

    - The command `git fetch origin` **fetches** any new work that has been **pushed** to that server since you **cloned** (or last **fetched** from) it.

    - The `git fetch` command only downloads the data to your local repository.

    - If I want get changes from the remote repository called `origin` into my local repository I type `git fetch origin`.

    - It doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.


    - the `git pull` command is a `git fetch` command followed by a `git merge` command.


    - Git sync does everything in one command meaning pull and push read here

   2. Branching

     - To view the branches in a Git repository, run the command `git branch`

     - To see both local and remote branches use `git branch -a` or `git branch --all`

     - To see details of each brach use `git branch -v` or `git brach --verbose`

     -

     - `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` creates a new branch and checks out the new branch

     - `git branch BRANCH_NAME` creates a new branch but leaves you on the same branch.

     - In other words `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` does the following for you:

       `git branch BRANCH_NAME    # create a new branch`
       `git switch BRANCH_NAME    # then switch to the new branch`


  C. How to open a pull request on GitHub.
    1. **Pull requests**  are the outstanding features or fixes that people are currently working on.
